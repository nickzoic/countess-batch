# CountESS Batch Frontend: TODOs

* Consider adding options to countess-batch to run these programs
instead of expecting the user to run them manually.

* Do we actually need any of the information in SampleSheet.csv
or can we glean the project / gene / bins layout from the tree of FASTQ files?
If so, is that better?

* consider adding a `--qsub` option to automatically queue the `countess_cmd`
